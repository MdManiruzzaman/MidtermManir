Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed
and modified efficiently. Data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the
functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Insertion and Deletion,
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
what is an Array?
Array is a container. Instead of declaring indivual variable number of times, we can declare multiple variables using array.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array cannot grow dynamically but ArrayList can. Array is a fixed length data structure but ArrayList is a variable
length collection class.In Array you have to declare the size but in ArrayList you don't. ArrayList can not store
primitives in, it can only contain Objects. Array is faster and arrayList is slower.
what is LinkedList?
A linked list is a linear data structure, consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference
to the next node in the list.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
Array is an index based data structure, every element is associated with an index whereas the linked list is a data
structure that uses references, each node is referred to another node. In array, size is fixed whereas in linked list
size is not fixed.
what is queue?
Queue is a Fast-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
what is stack?
Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
Stack memory is used for execution of a thread. Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO is first in first out used in Queue data structure, and LIFO is last in first out used in Stack data structure.
what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
1. HashMap is non synchronized. It can’t be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code whereas
Hashtable is synchronized. It can be shared with many threads.
2. HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn’t allow any null key or value.
3. HashMap is generally preferred over HashTable if thread synchronization is not needed
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
HashMap works on principle of Hashing.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index.
This exception is thrown when the index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
